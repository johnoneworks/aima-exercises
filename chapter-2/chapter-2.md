Exercise 1
Suppose that the performance measure is concerned with just the first T
 time steps of the environment and ignores everything thereafter. Show that a rational agentâ€™s action may depend not just on the state of the environment but also on the time step it has reached.

 Solution 1
 Suppose we have an environment with two squares A & B for our agent to land on, and the performance measure is to have give the agent points when it is on A when T is odd, and B when T is even.
