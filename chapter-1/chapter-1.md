Exercise 1
Define in your own words: (a) intelligence, (b) artificial intelligence, (c) agent, (d) rationality, (e) logical reasoning.

Solution 1
(a) Intelligence to me is the ability to make rational decisions.
(b) I would say this means systems that display intelligence that did not come about in nature.
(c) Agent is something that interacts with the environment.
(d) Tough, I would describe it as the ability to decide what is "good".
(e) I see this as a subset of rationality, where a part of being rational is the ability to perform logical reasoning.

Exercise 2
Read Turing’s original paper on AI Turing:1950 .In the paper, he discusses several objections to his proposed enterprise and his test for intelligence. Which objections still carry weight? Are his refutations valid? Can you think of new objections arising from developments since he wrote the paper? In the paper, he predicts that, by the year 2000, a computer will have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator. What chance do you think a computer would have today? In another 50 years?

Solution 2
I find the paper a very interesting read.
1. 
    - Consciousness argument still carry weight (clearly in my view).
    - Continuity vs. Discreet argument to me carries weight, I feel there are things in the continuous world that we have not yet fathomed.
    - Extrasensory perception still carries weight, since it's imposing that there are things that we have little knowledge of, so clearly we can't effectively handle it.
2. Turing is clearly very bright, I think his refutations are still very valid.
3. In the recent talks from Lex Fridman, I feel the concept of "understanding" is not addressed in Turing's paper, which I feel is a defining characteristic in intelligence.
4. I would feel it's in the high 90%s for now (2024).
5. Just looking at the Turing test, I feel it's close to 100%.

Exercise 3
Every year the Loebner Prize is awarded to the program that comes closest to passing a version of the Turing Test. Research and report on the latest winner of the Loebner prize. What techniques does it use? How does it advance the state of the art in AI?

Solution 3
N/A. This award is now defunct (since 2020). Reading the wikipedia I don't learn much and not interested to research more on defunct contests...

Exercise 4
Are reflex actions (such as flinching from a hot stove) rational? Are they intelligent?

Solution 4
I instinct answer is no for both. Upon reflection, I think it still holds. Reflex actions is good in the question's case, but there is no "decision" involved; and since I define intelligence to be making rational decisions, it concludes natrually that reflex actions are not intelligent actions. What is interesting is that I seem to not make differences in rationality and intelligence.

Exercise 5
There are well-known classes of problems that are intractably difficult for computers, and other classes that are provably undecidable. Does this mean that AI is impossible?

Solution 5
I don't see why that would be the case. We as humans can't solve intractable problems and undecidable problems efficiently, and I say we are intelligent, are we not?

Exercise 6
Suppose we extend Evans’s SYSTEM program so that it can score 200 on a standard IQ test. Would we then have a program more intelligent than a human? Explain.

Solution 6
We can only say that we have a program more intelligent than a human on stadard IQ tests.

Exercise 7
The neural structure of the sea slug Aplysis has been widely studied (first by Nobel Laureate Eric Kandel) because it has only about 20,000 neurons, most of them large and easily manipulated. Assuming that the cycle time for an Aplysis neuron is roughly the same as for a human neuron, how does the computational power, in terms of memory updates per second, compare with the high-end computer described in (Figure 1.3)?

Solution 7
I am assuming Figure 1.2.
The sea slug Aplysia has approximately the same cycle period as a human brain = 103. memory updates per second. The high-end computer computational power is 1014 memory updates per second, so a high-end computer is twice? (shoudl be ten times) as fast.

Exercise 8
How could introspection—reporting on one’s inner thoughts—be inaccurate? Could I be wrong about what I’m thinking? Discuss.

Solution 8
Some points that jump to mind:
a. The action of introspection could mutate the original thoughts, e.g. throwing in an extra parameter in your thought function could tamper the results itself.
b. I buy into the notion that in order to describe something, language is needed, and it is possible that there are many things not describable by language.
c. When introspecting, it is very difficult to account for all possible factors that result in your resulting thoughts, hence it's not going to accurately depict all aspects.
