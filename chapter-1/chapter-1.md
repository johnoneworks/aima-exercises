Exercise 1
Define in your own words: (a) intelligence, (b) artificial intelligence, (c) agent, (d) rationality, (e) logical reasoning.

Solution 1
(a) Intelligence to me is the ability to make rational decisions.
(b) I would say this means systems that display intelligence that did not come about in nature.
(c) Agent is something that interacts with the environment.
(d) Tough, I would describe it as the ability to decide what is "good".
(e) I see this as a subset of rationality, where a part of being rational is the ability to perform logical reasoning.

Exercise 2
Read Turingâ€™s original paper on AI Turing:1950 .In the paper, he discusses several objections to his proposed enterprise and his test for intelligence. Which objections still carry weight? Are his refutations valid? Can you think of new objections arising from developments since he wrote the paper? In the paper, he predicts that, by the year 2000, a computer will have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator. What chance do you think a computer would have today? In another 50 years?

Solution 2
I find the paper a very interesting read.
1. 
    - Consciousness argument still carry weight (clearly in my view).
    - Continuity vs. Discreet argument to me carries weight, I feel there are things in the continuous world that we have not yet fathomed.
    - Extrasensory perception still carries weight, since it's imposing that there are things that we have little knowledge of, so clearly we can't effectively handle it.
2. Turing is clearly very bright, I think his refutations are still very valid.
3. In the recent talks from Lex Fridman, I feel the concept of "understanding" is not addressed in Turing's paper, which I feel is a defining characteristic in intelligence.
4. I would feel it's in the high 90%s for now (2024).
5. Just looking at the Turing test, I feel it's close to 100%.

Exercise 3
Every year the Loebner Prize is awarded to the program that comes closest to passing a version of the Turing Test. Research and report on the latest winner of the Loebner prize. What techniques does it use? How does it advance the state of the art in AI?

Solution 3
N/A. This award is now defunct (since 2020). Reading the wikipedia I don't learn much and not interested to research more on defunct contests...
